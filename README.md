<h1>Intelligent Fire Alarm and Fighting System</h1>
<p>This project involves developing an intelligent fire alarm and fighting system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system is designed to detect fire and smoke in real-time through image and video analysis and automatically activate firefighting measures.</p>
DataSet Training model:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dakshmall/fire-and-smoke-detection <br>
Key Features: <br>
<b>Fire Detection:</b>
<p>Utilizes CNNs trained on the above dataset to accurately identify fire and smoke in images and video streams.</p>
<b>Real-time Monitoring:</b>
<p>Continuously monitors live video feeds to provide instant alerts in case of fire detection.</p>
<b>Automated Firefighting:</b>
<p>Integrates with automatic firefighting systems, such as sprinklers and extinguishers, to combat fires immediately upon detection.</p>
<b>Integrated Alarm:</b>
<p>Incorporates alarm systems to alert personnel and authorities immediately upon fire detection.</p>
